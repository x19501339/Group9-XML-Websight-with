                    <h6> At Habitual Hotel, we pride ourselves in serving some of the best services available, to both long-time stayers and new-comers, alike. We will try our utmost, so you can have the best stay you could have ever asked for. From the essentials such as comfortable beds and spacious rooms, to other luxuries and amenities, like an amazing view of either a beautiful, white-sand beach or serene flower garden, a state-of-the-art gym with a steam room, sauna and Olympic size swimming pool, a tennis court to remain active during your stay, a secure rooftop garden, a leisure room with a pool table, dart board and a variety of other arcade-like games to please the grumpy teens that accompany you. We stand by our promise to never disrupt your relaxation on your stay, while also always being there when you need us most. And don't worry, if the little ones are getting too much to handle, we have a day-care center, caring for children from ages 3-12, so you can drop everything (literally) and go off and do your own thing. You deserve it!   </h6>

			<h6> Founded in 2003 by a brotherly partnership, Habitual Hotel was originally designed to cater to all walks of life. From those who are outgoing, to those that contrast. We disagree with the scale of other hotel establishments, hence why we're not international. we want our customers to experience what's it's like to be pampered. Previously, we only had a handful of employees, all from the same family circle, now, 17 years later, we have over 100 staff across 3 different locations in Ireland, each location as popular as the last, with another one opening up in the 2nd quarter of 2022. We're proud to be Irish, and we're proud to have you on board!   </h6>
